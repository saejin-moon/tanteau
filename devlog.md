- i learned `impl`s!
- fully built the simple `Rng` impl using xorshift64* algo
- fully built the `Color` impl with support for rgba, hsl, hex, and cmyk
- set project up on gh and made this a proper git repo
- i think i figured out what `match` is for but it's still a little woozy in my cerebellum
- messed around with how modules and crates work
- updated the markdown files to be a bit more accurate and focused the vision of tanteau on what's feasible
- began work on the `DateTime` impl and established its structure
- name change from tanteau to tanto
